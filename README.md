BUPA Liver Disorders Data Set Summary

The BUPA Liver Disorders data set was created by BUPA Medical Research Limited and was donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository by Richard S. Forsyth in May 1990.[1] The data set is multivariate and includes categorical, integer and real attributes.[1] Each line of the data records  7 variables from one of a total of 345 male individuals.[1] The variables represented include the results of 5 blood tests that are considered potentially indicative of liver disorders that are caused by drinking excess alcohol.[1] The blood test results are the first 5 variables and include: 1) mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 2) alkaline phosphatase (alk phos), 3) alanine aminotransferase (sgpt), 4) aspartate aminotransferase (sgot), 5) gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma gt). The sixth variable is the number of half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages drunk per day (drinks) and the seventh variable is the selector field created by the BUPA researchers to split the data into train/test sets.[1] It is noted that the data set does not present any variables that denote the presence or absence of a liver disorder for each of the individuals.[1] The data set would be considered to be complete as there are no missing values.
